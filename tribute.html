    <h2>Hyper Text</h2>
    <p>We must first examine the idea of hypertext in order to comprehend the origins of HTML. 
       Early 20th-century pioneers like Vannevar Bush proposed the concept of tying information together through hypertext,
       envisioning a "memex" machine that could organize enormous volumes of information 
       using linked microfilm.</p>
       <p>However, Ted Nelson, an American philosopher and sociologist, first used the word "hypertext" in the 1960s.
        Nelson's idea of hypertext was to develop a network of connected text and multimedia
        that permitted non-linear information navigation.</p>
